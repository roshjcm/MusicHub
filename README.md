**Background**: Our course on Database Systems had a group project requiring students to create an application of their choice to sell a product. This is how we came up with MusicHub. 

# Purpose and Scope
This application will allow users to buy and listen to music released by independent artists who cannot utilize traditional streaming platforms. Currently, these artists are forced to upload their music to free hosting websites such as SoundCloud and arenâ€™t able to monetize the content they create. Independent music has always faced distribution obstacles and this database intends to solve one part of their problems. With this application, there is a transactional component, as well as a social one. We drew inspiration from the existing applications of iTunes, Spotify and Soundcloud. We aim to combine different elements from these two applications. 

We limit our artist entity to independent creators who have to create a profile instead of scraping music labels for their list of established artists. Listeners cannot add songs and albums to their library without purchasing them first. An artist can however choose to release free music.
